Firstly, I defined libraries and these libraries enable generating random numbers.

Here:

+ I started the random number generator.
+ I asked a questiopn.
+ I defined the names

I created a random number and got the mode according to the number variable.

The score decreases after each guess. 
So I take it off at every stage.

*Finally*,

I can't do these operations in the last player because this is not showing me the correct results.

__To give an example__, 

Total score 100, the first five players made 80 shots and last player. If the last player uses this code, the correct calculation isn't made. *For instance*, radnom number is 17 and this isn't true because Ä±t should be 20 so that the result is 100.
